Description of the Problem:

The 2 smallest states in the US are Rhode Island and Delaware. Looking at the capital cities of both, how do they stack up against each other? Most of the of the general population
is unfamilar with both states and cities as they are not the most reknowned, such as Manhattan or Los Angles. However, by comparing the 2, as a toursit looking to venture to either one
of these states, which one would you most likely visit.

Description of the Data:

To solve the problem of where a toursit would most likely visit out of the 2 smallest states in the US would be Foursquare and Zomato. Because Foursquare only returns basic 
firmographic data, the venue category, and a venue ID, we could leverage Zomato for more data info about venues. Specifically for restuarants. So any one who is a foodie can make
a better informed decision. Both APIs will give a combination of data for activities in that area as well as how good the food is.
